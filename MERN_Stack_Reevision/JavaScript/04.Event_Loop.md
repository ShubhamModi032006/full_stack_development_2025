# JavaScript Event Loop and Callback Functions
---

## Introduction to Asynchronous JavaScript

### What is Asynchronous Programming?

JavaScript is **single-threaded**, meaning it can only do one thing at a time. However, we often need to perform tasks that take time (like waiting for a server response, reading files, or setting timers) without freezing the entire application.

**Asynchronous programming** allows JavaScript to:
- Start a task
- Move on to other tasks while waiting
- Come back to the original task when it's finished

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous Example

```javascript
// SYNCHRONOUS (Blocking) - JavaScript's default behavior
console.log(1);
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
    console.log(5); // This will print 5, 100,000 times
}
console.log(2);
console.log(4);
console.log(3);
// Output: 1, then 5 printed 100,000 times, then 2, 4, 3
```

**Problem**: The `for` loop blocks everything else until it's completely finished!

## What are Callback Functions?

### Definition
A **callback function** is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed at a later time or when a specific event occurs.

### Simple Analogy
Think of a callback like giving someone your phone number and asking them to "call you back" when they're done with their task.

### Basic Callback Example

```javascript
// This is a callback function
setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("I am paused for 5 seconds");
}, 5000);
```

**Explanation**:
- `setTimeout` is the main function
- `function () { console.log("I am paused for 5 seconds"); }` is the **callback function**
- `5000` is the delay in milliseconds (5 seconds)
- The callback will be executed after 5 seconds

---

## Understanding setTimeout and setInterval

### setTimeout - Execute Once After Delay

```javascript
// Basic setTimeout syntax
setTimeout(callbackFunction, delayInMilliseconds);

// Example 1: Simple delayed message
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Hello, Student!"); // Message after 1 second
}, 1000);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Welcome to JavaScript!"); // Message after 2 seconds
}, 2000);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Let's learn timing functions!"); // Message after 3 seconds
}, 3000);
```

**What happens**:
1. All three `setTimeout` calls are registered immediately
2. JavaScript doesn't wait - it continues to the next line
3. After 1 second: "Hello, Student!" appears
4. After 2 seconds: "Welcome to JavaScript!" appears
5. After 3 seconds: "Let's learn timing functions!" appears

### setInterval - Execute Repeatedly

```javascript
// Basic setInterval syntax
setInterval(callbackFunction, intervalInMilliseconds);

// Example: Countdown timer
let count = 2;
let x = setInterval(function () {
    if (count <= 0) {
        clearInterval(x); // Stop the interval
    }
    console.log(count--); // Print current count, then decrease it
}, 1000);
```

**What happens**:
1. Every 1 second, the callback function runs
2. It prints the current count and decreases it
3. When count reaches 0, it stops the interval
4. Output: 2, 1, 0 (then stops)

### Stopping Intervals

```javascript
let intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    console.log("This runs every 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

// To stop it later:
clearInterval(intervalId);
```

## The JavaScript Event Loop

### The Core Problem JavaScript Solves

**JavaScript alone can't convert synchronous to asynchronous operations.**

It needs help from **Web APIs (Browser)** to handle:
- `setTimeout()`
- `setInterval()`
- `localStorage`
- `fetch`
- `promises`

### How the Event Loop Works

The Event Loop has three main components:

1. **Call Stack** - Where synchronous code runs
2. **Web APIs** - Browser features that handle async operations
3. **Callback Queue** - Where completed async operations wait

### Step-by-Step Event Loop Process

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout 1");
}, 0);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout 2");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

**Execution Flow**:

1. **Call Stack**: `console.log("Start")` → prints "Start"
2. **Call Stack**: `setTimeout` → hands callback to Web APIs
3. **Call Stack**: `setTimeout` → hands callback to Web APIs
4. **Call Stack**: `console.log("End")` → prints "End"
5. **Call Stack**: Empty!
6. **Event Loop**: Checks if Call Stack is empty (YES)
7. **Event Loop**: Moves callbacks from Queue to Call Stack
8. **Call Stack**: First timeout callback → prints "Timeout 1"
9. **Call Stack**: Second timeout callback → prints "Timeout 2"

**Final Output**:
```
Start
End
Timeout 1
Timeout 2
```

### The Golden Rule

> **"The event loop will push code to call stack only when call stack is empty"**

This means:
- Synchronous code always runs first
- Asynchronous callbacks wait in the queue
- Only when the main thread is free do callbacks get executed

## Web APIs and Browser Environment

### Why JavaScript Needs Web APIs

JavaScript is single-threaded, but browsers provide **Web APIs** that can handle multiple operations simultaneously:

- **Timer APIs**: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`
- **Storage APIs**: `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`
- **Network APIs**: `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`
- **DOM APIs**: Event listeners, animations

### Example: How setTimeout Works Behind the Scenes

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Delayed message");
}, 2000);
```

**What happens**:
1. JavaScript calls `setTimeout`
2. Browser's Timer API starts a 2-second timer
3. JavaScript continues executing other code
4. After 2 seconds, Timer API puts callback in Queue
5. Event Loop moves callback to Call Stack when it's empty
6. Callback executes and prints "Delayed message"

## Callback Hell and Solutions

### What is Callback Hell?

**Callback Hell** (also called "Pyramid of Doom") occurs when you have many nested callbacks, making code hard to read and maintain.

### Example of Callback Hell

```javascript
// Nested callbacks - CALLBACK HELL!
orderFood(2000, function () {
    prepareFood(5000, () => {
        deliverFood(3000, () => {
            enjoyFood(10000, () => {
                doWalking(5000, () => {
                    sleep(10000000000);
                });
            });
        });
    });
});
```

**Problems with this approach**:
- Hard to read and understand
- Difficult to debug
- Error handling becomes complex
- Code becomes unmaintainable

### Sequential vs Parallel Execution

#### Sequential Execution (One after another)
```javascript
// Washing clothes example - SEQUENTIAL
function washClothes(time, cb) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        cb();
    }, time);
}

function dryClothes(time, cb) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Clothes are Dried");
        cb();
    }, time);
}

function ironClothes(time) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Clothes are ironed");
    }, time);
}

// Sequential execution using callbacks
washClothes(7000, function () {
    dryClothes(3000, function () {
        ironClothes(2000);
    });
});
```

**Timeline**:
- 0s: Start washing
- 7s: Washing done, start drying
- 10s: Drying done, start ironing
- 12s: Ironing done

#### Parallel Execution (All at once)
```javascript
// Parallel execution - all start at the same time
function washClothes() {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Clothes are washed");
    }, 7000);
}

function dryClothes() {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Clothes are Dried");
    }, 5000);
}

function ironClothes() {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Clothes are ironed");
    }, 3000);
}

// All start immediately
washClothes();
dryClothes();
ironClothes();
```

**Timeline**:
- 0s: All three start
- 3s: Ironing done
- 5s: Drying done
- 7s: Washing done

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Food Ordering System

```javascript
function prepareFood(time, cb) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Food is being prepared");
        cb();
    }, time);
}

function deliverFood(time, cb) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Food is delivered");
        cb();
    }, time);
}

function enjoyFood(time) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Enjoy your food");
    }, time);
}

// Sequential food ordering
prepareFood(5000, () => {
    deliverFood(3000, () => {
        enjoyFood(10000);
    });
});
```

### Example 2: Task Management

```javascript
// Task 1: Delayed Message Display
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Hello, Student!"); // After 1 second
}, 1000);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Welcome to JavaScript!"); // After 2 seconds
}, 2000);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Let's learn timing functions!"); // After 3 seconds
}, 3000);
```

### Example 3: Countdown Timer

```javascript
let count = 5;
let timer = setInterval(() => {
    if (count <= 0) {
        clearInterval(timer);
        console.log("Time's up!");
    } else {
        console.log(count);
        count--;
    }
}, 1000);
```
